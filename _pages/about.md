I studied biochemistry. Like other areas of biology, this was so fascinating to me that felt (and still feels) indistinguishable from science-fiction. When I learned programming, I discovered a whole new world of methodologies that could be applied to untangled biological mysteries.  So, I moved to Barcelona to pursue my MsC in Bioinformatics. Then, I worked briefly in the pharma industry at Janssen before going back to Barcelona to start my Phd. I completed it in July 2020, under the supervision of [Prof. Gianni de Fabritiis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-_kX4kMAAAAJ&hl=en). The main topic was the study of intrinsically disordered proteins using molecular dynamics simulations. 

In 2021, I started working as a Postdoc Researcher at the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid under the supervision of [Prof. Ramón Diaz Uriarte](https://scholar.google.es/citations?hl=es&user=qO6_YMgAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) in the analysis of cross-sectional data to understand cancer evolution. He was a former teacher of mine, actually, the one that taught me to program in the first place. (I appreciate this kind of real-life easter eggs).

On a more personal note...
------

I grew up in a small rural town from La Mancha, yeah, that's right, like Don Quixote. Over the last ten years, I have been lucky enough to live in many cities: Madrid, Toledo, Barcelona. 

In my free time, I combine my love for nature, wildlife, putting myself at risk, and sports in as many ways as I can imagine. This includes climbing, skating, boxing, photography or, simply, taking my good old dog for a walk.

Some years ago, when I had long hair. At the top of my first 3k: *Monte Perdido* in the beautiful *Ordesa & Monte Perdido* National Park.
